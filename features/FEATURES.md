# Neurolens AI Feature Inventory

This document lists **all feature types** extracted by this stage of the Neurolens pipeline:  
- Acoustic features (`acoustics.py`)  
- Linguistic features (`linguistics.py`)  
- LLM-derived cognitive reasoning scores (`llm_scores.py`)  

Only the **acoustic section** is filled for now — the other sections are placeholders you will populate later.
